# 42-swap_push

Some algorithm stuff, made for fun (because who doesnt love coding & algorithm).
Its split up into two parts: checker and push_swap

## checker
Takes a list of integers from args and a list of instructions from STDIN.
Executes instructions on the list of ints and then prints OK if sorted and KO if not

## push_swap
Also takes a list of integers, but instead prints the instructions necessary to sort them. (the same format as the checker takes them)

# How to run
Each project directory has a makefile that you can run with `make`. There is also one in the root that will compile all other project makefiles.

Project makefiles output in a `./build` directory
